These are my second ever brownies but I had a lot of
help from Michael Oliver.

This recipe belongs to him.

This was done originally with pomegranate
seeds instead of strawberry skins.

* Strawberry brownies
** Ingredients
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 1/4 cup organic raw cane sugar
- 3/4 cup cacao powder
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 vanilla pod-scraped (or 1/2 tsp of vanilla paste)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup sifted Flour
- 1/2 cup strawberry skins
- 2 tablespoons cacao nibs
- flaky salt

** Apparatus
- parchment paper
- large mixing bowl
- whisk
- spoon
- baking dish
- toothpick
- paring knife

** Method
1. Preheat the oven to 170 degrees and line an 8 x 8 baking dish with parchment
   paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the oil, cane sugar, cacao powder,
   salt, vanilla until combined.
   Add eggs one at a time until fully incorporated.
3. Add in the flour and mix slowly and gently until smooth. Do not over mix,
   this may result in a dryer batter.(The batter will be thick).
4. Spoon it into the baking dish. Sprinkle the top with strawberry skins and
   cacao nibs. Bake for about 40 minutes. To test for doneness, the edges should
   be hard and formed and a toothpick into the center should come out slightly
   wet.
5. Sprinkle the brownies with flaky salt and allow them to cool completely in
   the pan before cutting. This step is very important.

** How to scrape a vanilla bean
Vanilla is a beloved ingredient for its
ability to enhance the flavor and aroma of any
confection; it is an essential ingredient in
everything from cakes and whipped cream to
jams and ice cream.

To remove the skins from the bean, simply use
a paring knife to slice the pod in half.

Then, use the back of the knife to scrape the
skins away from the pod.

What's more is that the empty pod can also be
used.

Stick it in a jar of sugar, seal, and let sit
for a week.

The vanilla's flavor and aroma will infuse
into the sugar, which can be used in baking,
stirred into coffee and tea, or sprinkled over
French toast and crêpes.

** Using Real Vanilla Beans in a Recipe
One vanilla bean is roughly equivalent to
about 3 teaspoons vanilla extract, so if
you’re substituting one for the other, you may
only need part of a vanilla bean to make a
recipe calling for extract — this said, a
little extra vanilla bean generally doesn’t
hurt!

The extra skins will give your recipe a warm,
rich, fully infused vanilla flavor.

** My steps
- get a baking dish (glass or ceramic, rectangular tapered dish with handles for gloves)
- line the baking dish with parchment
- scrape half a vanilla pod

  - Slice the pod in half with a small, sharp knife.
  - use the back of the knife to scrape the skins away from the pod.
- get a mixing bowl and whisk together
  - 0.5 cup olive oil
  - 1.25 cup cane sugar
  - 0.75 cup cacao powder
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - half a vanilla pod-scraped
  - 2 large eggs (fully mix one at a time)
  - [[./whisking.mp4][whisking in the bowl]]
- mix 1/3 cup sifted Flour into the same bowl slowly and gently until smooth
  - mix slowly and gently
  - don't over-mix!
- Spoon the mix into the baking dish.

- Sprinkle the top with strawberry skins and cacao nibs.
  - What's the correct density?
    - [[./low density.jpg]]
    - Let the strawberry skins fall where they may.
    - [[./high density.jpg]]
    - I ended up going with a higher strawberry skin density and went all out on the cacao nibs as well.
- Bake until done (about 40 minutes).
  - The edges should be hard and formed
  - A toothpick into the center should come out slightly wet
  - [[./before.mp4][Before placing in the oven]]
- Sprinkle the brownies with flaky salt
  - [[./done.jpg]]
- Allow the brownie slab to cool before cutting.
